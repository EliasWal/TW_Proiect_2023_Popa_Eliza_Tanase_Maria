                    This application will be a Web Baby Info Manager designated to help parents keep track of their children's most important
                    information. It is designed to make the task of being a parent easier by providing tools to assist in scheduling 
                    the every day life, as well as saving resources and documenting about their children's needs. By providing these tools,
                    the application will meet parents' needs while remaining easy to understand and use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, the "<i>Baby Manager</i>" application is constructed to allow a parent to manage and save information
                    and multimedia resources about timetables, medical histories, relationships with other children and personal journal 
                    entries. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this application is to offer its users a safe place to stack their information concerning raising a child 
                    and to access them at any time, from any device.

                    The application uses a library to style a "<i>Hamburger Menu</i>", which can be identified by three horizontal lines,
                    that appears in the topbar section when the screen size is smaller (than 915 px). 
                    By clicking on it, the menu for navigating the application will appear on the right side of the screen, and by 
                    clicking the "<i>X</i>" icon, it will disappear. The reason to use this feature 
                    comes from the need to create a responsive design and to have a pleasant interface for any of the application's 
                    users, regarding of the device they use. The library can be found at

                    The Web application "<i>Baby Manager</i>" is intended for the parents and parents-to-be who are looking for 
                management and organizing features for their children's journeys. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    A <i>guest user</i> is a person that has their first encounter with the application or a person that is not logged in.
                    They have access to the "<i>Welcome</i>" page, where they can learn information about what they could 
                    benefit once they create an account. The page is designed so that the guest user will be well documented about the 
                    features and their uses, as to make a right decision whether or not to join. A guest user also has the possibility to
                    sign up and become a <i>logged user</i>. By trying to log in without an account already created, the user will get a 
                    warning about their credentials not being in the database. A guest user doesn't have access to any of the actual 
                    features for managing their children's information. Parents or soon to be parents that are searching for applications
                    about raising children may fit in this category. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <i>logged user</i> is a person that has previously created an account by signing up and used their credentials to
                    log in their said account.
