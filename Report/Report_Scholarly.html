                <p> 
                    This application will be a Web Baby Info Manager designated to help parents keep track of their children's most important
                    information. It is designed to make the task of being a parent easier by providing tools to assist in scheduling 
                    the every day life, as well as saving resources and documenting about their children's needs. By providing these tools,
                    the application will meet parents' needs while remaining easy to understand and use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, the "<i>Baby Manager</i>" application is constructed to allow a parent to manage and save information
                    and multimedia resources about timetables, medical histories, relationships with other children and personal journal 
                    entries. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this application is to offer its users a safe place to stack their information concerning raising a child 
                    and to access them at any time, from any device.

                <p> 
                    The application uses a library to style a "<i>Hamburger Menu</i>", which can be identified by three horizontal lines,
                    that appears in the topbar section when the screen size is smaller (than 915 px). 
                    By clicking on it, the menu for navigating the application will appear on the right side of the screen, and by 
                    clicking the "<i>X</i>" icon, it will disappear. The reason to use this feature 
                    comes from the need to create a responsive design and to have a pleasant interface for any of the application's 
                    users, regarding of the device they use. The library can be found at

                <p> 
                    The Web application "<i>Baby Manager</i>" is intended for the parents and parents-to-be who are looking for 
                management and organizing features for their children's journeys. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    A <i>guest user</i> is a person that has their first encounter with the application or a person that is not logged in.
                    They have access to the "<i>Welcome</i>" page, where they can learn information about what they could 
                    benefit once they create an account. The page is designed so that the guest user will be well documented about the 
                    features and their uses, as to make a right decision whether or not to join. A guest user also has the possibility to
                    sign up and become a <i>logged user</i>. By trying to log in without an account already created, the user will get a 
                    warning about their credentials not being in the database. A guest user doesn't have access to any of the actual 
                    features for managing their children's information. Parents or soon to be parents that are searching for applications
                    about raising children may fit in this category. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <i>logged user</i> is a person that has previously created an account by signing up and used their credentials to
                    log in their said account. They have access to all the pages involved in the process of navigating the application, 
                    including: Home, Settings, Memories, Calendars, Friends and Medical. A logged user is the only one that can save and
                    manage their information within the "<i>Baby manager</i>" application. Every time they enter their account again, the
                    information will be loaded from the database. They can also, at any point, log out of their account and become a 
                    <i>guest user</i>, with no way of accessing data until they log in back again. For the most part, the application is 
                    dedicated to this class of users, that will frequently visit the pages and interact with them. Parents and some soon
                    to be parents that are searcing and/or currently using applications about raising children may fit in this category.

            <h2> 3. User interfaces </h2>
            <p>
                The "<i>Baby Manager</i>" web application intends to create a pleasing and easy to navigate user interface, as well as 
                clear and concise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial "Welcome" page, as well as all the other pages, have an aesthetically pleasing appearence, with bright colors
                like purple and pink, to create an almost childish look. Here the user can find the buttons "Sign up" and "Log in" which
                are vital for connecting to an account and using the features. "Sign up" is used to create a new account, whereas "Log in"
                is used to enter an already created account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important tool that the user can find in every page is the topbar. Located at the start area of the page, it 
                contains features with links for navigating the whole application. The user can access Memories, Calendars, Friends,
                Medical, Home and Settings, as well as press the now "Log out" button to disconnect from their account.
            </p>
            <p>
                By pressing the wheel-like image next to the "Log out" button, the user accesses their personal profile settings. They can, 
                then, choose from the leftside menu, whether they want to manage their general settings, their children's information or
                change their password. <!--Each one of these pages have forms that can be edited by adding input or choosing from a dropdown
                list and pressing the "Edit" or "Save" button. "Manage your children" feature has two additional buttons, "Add child" and 
                "Delete" that will create new fields for another child or eliminate the wanted fields.-->
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the main pages "Memories", "Calendars", "Friends", "Medical" have an introductive page to describe the tools that
                will be used and what is the scope of them. The user will, in consequence, have at their disposal a short documentation 
                prepared for navigating easily. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the left menu, the user can choose, from their list of children, which one's page and 
                information they want to see. After choosing the prefered child in any of the pages "Memories", "Calendars" and "Medical"
                another page of information will be accessed.
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                In the page "Memories" the user can see the journal entries that contain an image and a part
                of the description and, above them, the date of the memory. When the user hovers over the journal entry, the whole 
                description becomes visible.

                "Calendars" offers a form-like page, with input fields for time and notes, as well as checkboxes to mark as done one of the
                activities, sleep or feed.

                The "Medical" page loads a table of information concerning the health problems the user's child had.

            <p>
                For the "Friends" page, as a difference, all the data of the user's children is stored in one page. <!--where they can find a list
                of people associated with a photo and a relationship. --> Here, in the leftside menu, they can open the list of friends, 
                as well as to add a new friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the beforesaid pages have some of the buttons used for adding, editing, saving, deleting or sharing on Social Media
                platforms the prefered information, through forms.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In what concerns responsiveness, the pages were carefully created and updated for any possible device. For example,
                for the "Medical" page, if we are to talk about a smaller size, the line with the record data becomes smaller and so 
                a "More" page, which shows the information unfiltered, is needed.
